Server-Side-Routing: Server compiles the document or html file in order for the browser to read and render new page. Ideal for search engine optimiztion. Client-Side-Routing: Data is managed within it's own memory database. A basic json is returned, instead of an entire page/template. Also in addition, the browser doesn't refresh because it is no longer compiling data to render, but relying on databse/stored data.
